# Sorting-Algorithms
A repo for sorting algorithm practice

You can see how their sort times vary using the showcase program.
The value at the top can be changed to alter how many values are sorted.
A value of 10,000 works best on my system as it is easy to see the difference in sort time.
A value of 100,000 yielded a sort time of 392.55 seconds with insertion sort! That's almost 7 minutes!


Included algorithms:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Quick Sort

Need to add algorithms:
1. Heap Sort
